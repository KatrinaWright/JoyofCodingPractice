When coding, consider the following guidelines:

● Correctness: Your code should perform as specified. Correctness will count for the
largest portion of your grade.

● Comments: For each function/method that you design from scratch, write a summary
comment. Within functions, the more complicated parts of your code should be
described using "internal" comments.

● Programming style: Your variable names should be meaningful and your code as simple
and clear as possible. Each line must be less than 80 characters long including spaces &
comments. You can break up long lines using \ in python, or newlines in Java.

● DRYness: If you find yourself repeating a task, you can add a helper function and call
that function instead of duplicating the code, or place the code inside a loop. A good
rule of thumb is if a function/method is more than about 20 lines long, consider
introducing helper functions to do some of the work, even if they are only called once.
