Arrays & Dictionaries

Activity: Arrays & Files

In this assignment we will explore working with files & arrays in preparation for Project 3.
1. Manually download the file turing.txt:
http://emhill.github.io/150/morea/10.dict//data/turing.txt & save to your computer or
upload to repl.it.
2. Create a new program in your favorite editor. Create an array (or list) in your program to
store each line of the file as a separate element.
3. Open the file, read in each line into your array/list, and close the file.
4. Print out the first & last two elements of your array/list, and the number of lines in the
file.
5. Your program should not take any user input.
When coding, consider the following guidelines:

● Correctness: Your code should perform as specified. Correctness will count for the
largest portion of your grade.

● Comments: For each function/method that you design from scratch, write a summary
comment. Within functions, the more complicated parts of your code should be
described using "internal" comments.

● Programming style: Your variable names should be meaningful and your code as simple
and clear as possible. Each line must be less than 80 characters long including spaces &
comments. You can break up long lines using \ in python, or newlines in Java.

● DRYness: If you find yourself repeating a task, you can add a helper function and call
that function instead of duplicating the code, or place the code inside a loop. A good
rule of thumb is if a function/method is more than about 20 lines long, consider
introducing helper functions to do some of the work, even if they are only called once.

Notes:

● In python, there is no difference between a list and an array

● In Java, consider using an ArrayList rather than an array
